# hello-world
My first repository.  Created using instructions in the getting startet guide.
I am a highly educated, economically priveleged, white queer woman living in the southwestern area of the United States.  I like science, data analysis & visualization, swan queen fanfiction, pumpkin carving, putting things in containers, upcycling, and doodling.
